## What's `ethereum-optimism/tests`?

`ethereum-optimism/tests` is a portable suite of standardized test fixtures used to test OP Stack component implementations. Test fixtures are static JSON files defined in the [fixtures](./fixtures) directory.

There are two types of tests:
- `derivation`
- `execution`

Each has it's own cli tool to generate test fixtures. [opt8n](./bin/opt8n) can be used to generate execution test fixtures, while [opdn](./bin/opdn) generates derivation test fixtures.

### Development Status

`ethereum-optimism/tests` is currently in active development, and is not yet ready for use in production.

## Overview

**`op-test-vectors`**

A rust crate exposing types used to generate test fixtures in [./fixtures](./fixtures/).

`op-test-vectors` contains two primary modules:

- [`execution`](./crates/op-test-vectors/src/execution.rs): Rust types for the execution test fixtures.
- [`derivation`](./crates/op-test-vectors/src/derivation.rs): Rust types for the derivation test fixtures.

**`opt8n`**

A binary to generate execution test fixtures.

`opt8n` has two subcommands:

- `repl`: Spins up a REPL that allows the user to send transactions to and generate a test fixture from those transactions.
- `script`: Executes a forge script against an anvil instance and generates the test fixture.

**`opdn`**

A binary to generate derivation test fixtures.

`opdn` has the following subcommands:

- `from-l2`: Generates a derivation test fixture from the specified range of L2 blocks.
- `from-l1`: Generates a derivation test fixture from the specified range of L1 blocks.
- `info`: Outputs the L2 block info including the L1 origin for the given L2 block number.

## Book

The [book][book] contains an in-depth overview of the project, contributor guidelines, and tutorials for creating your own test fixtures as well as you own test runners.

## Credits

`ethereum-optimism/tests` is inspired by [ethereum/tests][eth-tests] and built by the collaboration between a number of teams and external contributors including [OP Labs][op-labs] and [Worldcoin engineers][worldcoin].
